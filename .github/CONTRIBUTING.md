There are [Five Principles of Bug Tracking](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html)
we expect you to respect. When you report a bug, please make sure:

  * It is not a duplicate, search the repo first;
  * It follows the [guideline](/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md);
  * It is not a question, but a bug;
  * It is intended to make the product better.

When you submit a pull request, make sure:

  * It is not too big (less than 100 lines of code modified);
  * The build is clean after your changes;
  * Its description explains the changes made.

Thanks for your contribution, we appreciate it.
